## Features

- **Create Crowdfunding Campaigns**: Users can create crowdfunding campaigns with a specific target amount they aim to raise.

- **Contribute with Ether**: Participants can contribute to ongoing campaigns by sending Ether to the contract.

- **Interest Earnings through Aave**: The contract utilizes the Aave V2 lending protocol to deposit ETH and earn interest on the contributions.

- **Claim Participation Certificates**: Upon successful completion of a campaign, contributors can claim participation certificates as tokenized proof of their support.

- **Refund on Campaign Failure**: If a campaign fails to reach its target amount, contributors can withdraw their contributed funds.

- **Withdraw Raised Funds**: After a campaign reaches its funding goal, the campaign creator can withdraw the raised funds for the intended purpose.

## External Dependencies

1. [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/): The contract leverages various libraries and contracts from the OpenZeppelin library, including `Ownable`, `ERC721`, and `Clones`.

2. [Aave](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/the-core-protocol/weth-gateway): The contract integrates with the Aave V2 lending protocol to deposit ETH and generate interest for the contract.

## Set up

To set up the FundWise Smart Contract locally or deploy it to the network, follow these steps:

1. Copy the contents of `.env.example` to a new file called `.env` and add the relevant API keys or addresses.

2. Utilize the scripts from the `package.json` file for relevant tasks related to deployment or local setup.

## Contract Deployment

The contract is deployed on the network with the following initial parameters:

1. LENDING_POOL_PROVIDER_ADDRESS: Aave Lending Pool provider contract address.
2. AAVE_V2_ADDRESS: Aave V2 contract address.
3. AAVE_ATOKEN_ADDRESS: Aave aToken contract address.

Please ensure that you provide the correct values for these parameters during deployment.

## Future Scope

We have exciting plans for the future development of the FundWise Smart Contract. Some of the upcoming features include:

1. **Stablecoin Fundraising**: Adding another type of crowdfunding contract that allows users to create fundraisers using stablecoins, providing more flexibility to both creators and participants.

2. **Multi-Chain Support**: Expanding to other chains like mainnet and various layer 2 chains, enabling a wider user base to participate in crowdfunding campaigns.

We are committed to continually enhancing the FundWise Smart Contract to provide the best crowdfunding experience for our users.
